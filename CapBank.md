# Capacitor Bank

For my Capacitor, I decided to, instead of blowingf 800$+ on a capacitor actually rated for the grueling conditions of a tesla coil, I made a bank of smaller
pulse Capacitors. This bank is often refered to as a "MMC". For my capacitors, I used the 942C20P15K-F by Cornell-Dubilier. Each capacitor is rated for 2000VDC, and 0.15uF. In my bank, I also put
so called "bleed" ressistors across each capacitor terminal, so when the coil is turned off, the capacitors held charge discharges through the ressistors. In my case, since im using a relativly "low power" power supply,
so the best ressistors for me are a 10mÎ© (10,000,000 Olms), 1/2 Watt, 5%. I used some pieces of Acrylic (Polymethyl methacrylate) pieces -> measurements coming soon <-.
