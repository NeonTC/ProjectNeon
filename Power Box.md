# Power Box

I plan making a project button box to control the functions of the tesla coil, such as a dial of sorts to control the power gaven to it, such as a variac
and have many saftey measures such as a key switch, and built in breaker. Also to have buttons to turn on the Spark Gap Fan (because it generates alot of O^1 (Ozone) which 
in larger quantities is poisonous and dangerous to the atmosphere. Also a button and dial to control the speed of the future rotary spark gap speed, whether to increase the 
rpm or decrease it.
