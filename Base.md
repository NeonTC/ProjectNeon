# Base

I used a 2ft - diameter spool that was used for wire, but if you cant get that, I recommend buying a 2 shelf coffee table. I recommend ~2ft because my secondary winding is 4.5" in diameter
and I want to give it about a 5 inch space before laying the primary coil down so just base it off of your own measurements. But if you cant give proper space between the secondary winding
and the primary (which is highly important), but lots of insulating bubble wrap, or a good insulator between them so it dosent arc between the coils, burn the varnish and destroy
the secondary.
